To run the backend, you need to have a PostgreSQL server (with the PostGIS extension installed) running on the localhost.
The server needs to have a user called "postgres" with the password "password". 

You can import the initial DB data by running the SQL script called SQLDUMP.sql in this folder. This will create the needed tables and columns, and input initial data.
